explode robot - explosion tilts blocks in radius? (only pushable blocks)
spawn assets/animation, drop from ceiling? dispenser? scientis pulls out, then grows?
laser redirection bot - line renderer component same as laser block, but enable/disable based on level state



interactions with pushing stacked blocks and falling stacks - push grabbed block over edge
when a block is exploded, check if things are on top and add them to movedBlocks to be iteratively fallen
when something is blown up, recompute lasers to see if they can hit something new

jumping with block on head - probably negligible - could try to redo as two pushes within one func before consequences

aight guys here's the lowdown
top priority/bare minimum:
grab animation for scientist and block robot (make block robot default pose fit in block, arms in)
cracked block that can be destroyed by explosions

secondary priority:
walk animation: scientist + robot
jump animation: robot only
sound
